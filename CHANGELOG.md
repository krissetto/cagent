## [Unreleased]

## What's New
- Adds schema v9 with canonical `subagents` field while continuing to accept legacy `sub_agents`
- Ships runtime-managed subagents with top-level YAML opt-in via `subagents:`
- Adds user-facing documentation for runtime-managed subagents and live session tree observability / control
- Adds live-session API endpoints for tree inspection, attach (SSE), steer, follow-up, close, and stop

## Improvements
- Documents runtime-managed subagents as the long-term replacement for legacy `transfer_task`, `background_agents`, and `handoff` multi-agent flows
- Rejects mixing runtime-managed `subagents:` with legacy `handoffs:` or `background_agents` on the same agent, and suppresses legacy implicit `transfer_task` injection when `subagents:` is present
- Clarifies migration guidance and rollout status for the new subagent subsystem
- Makes `subagent_inspect` cost- and context-aware by default: returns only the subagent's latest assistant message plus status metadata, with opt-in `mode: "recent"` / `mode: "full"` for callers that need transcript history

## [v1.46.0] - 2026-04-16

This release adds OAuth credential configuration for MCP servers, evaluation testing improvements, and numerous stability fixes.

- Adds support for `xhigh` effort level in Anthropic adaptive thinking (Claude Opus 4.7+)
- Adds `task_budget` configuration field for Claude Opus 4.7 to cap total tokens across multi-step tasks
- Adds markdown rendering support in user_prompt dialog messages

## Improvements
- Improves image attachment handling by inlining as base64 data URLs for cross-provider compatibility
- Improves robots.txt caching to store parsed data per host instead of boolean results
- Improves session database version detection with clear upgrade messages for newer databases

## Bug Fixes
- Fixes `--attach` flag being silently ignored when used without a message argument

- Fixes assistant text being discarded when tool calls are present in Responses API conversion
- Fixes MCP OAuth token refresh by remembering the discovered auth server

## Technical Changes
