// Plan management messages drive the /plans browser. Dialogs emit these
// intents; the app model services them through the pkg/plans host service and
// pushes fresh data back into the open dialogs. Dialogs never touch storage.
//
// Shared-plan mutation messages carry the version that was displayed when
// the user chose the action (never nil), so every shared write is guarded by
// optimistic locking and a concurrent change surfaces as an actionable
// conflict instead of a silent overwrite. The session plan has no versions:
// its only mutation is an EditPlanMsg carrying the sentinel ExpectedVersion
// 0, and the write is last-write-wins by design.
