_Connect to remote agents via the Agent-to-Agent protocol._

## Overview

The A2A tool connects to a remote agent exposed over the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol. Unlike [`handoff`](../handoff/index.md), which only targets local agents declared in the same config, `a2a` reaches out to an agent running on the network.

## Configuration

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: a2a
    url: "http://localhost:8082"
    allow_private_ips: true # Only for trusted local or internal agents
    # Optional: prefix for each remote skill's tool name
    name: research_agent
    # Optional: custom HTTP headers (typically for auth)
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${env.A2A_TOKEN}"
      X-Tenant: "acme"
```

Configured headers authenticate invocation requests, but are not sent while fetching the agent card. The current tool therefore cannot discover a server protected by `docker agent serve a2a --auth-token`, which also protects the agent-card endpoint.

The `url` is the server base URL used to discover `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. Local and private-IP servers require `allow_private_ips: true`.

## Properties

| Property   | Type             | Required | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`      | string           | ✓        | A2A server endpoint URL (must include scheme).                                                           |
| `name`     | string           | ✗        | Prefix for each remote skill's tool name. Without it, names use the skill ID or name; cards without skills use the agent name.     |
| `headers`  | map\[string\]string | ✗     | Extra HTTP headers sent with invocation requests, not agent-card discovery (useful for authentication, tenant selection, and tracing). |

`allow_private_ips` is an optional boolean, defaulting to `false`. It permits agent-card and invocation requests to non-public IP addresses; enable it only for trusted internal agents.

When Docker Desktop is running, eligible requests use its PAC adapter before environment proxy settings. Set `DOCKER_AGENT_DISABLE_DESKTOP_PROXY=1` (or `true`, `yes`, or `on`) to restore standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` routing; `NO_PROXY` does not bypass Docker Desktop PAC selection. Docker Agent does not evaluate PAC files or URLs directly—see [Docker Desktop proxy](../fetch/index.md#docker-desktop-proxy).

## Startup failure behaviour

Starting the toolset fetches the remote agent's card (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`). When that request fails with one of a fixed set of retryable HTTP statuses — 429 Too Many Requests, 408 Request Timeout, 500/502/503/504, or 529 (Anthropic-style "overloaded") — Docker Agent paces the next start attempt with the same [bounded exponential backoff gate](../rag/index.md#indexing-failures-retries-and-backoff) that remote MCP and RAG embedding calls use, instead of re-fetching the card on every agent turn. This is a fixed enumeration, not a full 5xx range: less-common codes such as 501, 505, or the Cloudflare 520–527 family do not arm the gate. A server-supplied `Retry-After` header, when present, is honored.

Everything else fails fast, retried every turn with no artificial delay: DNS failures, connection refused, SSRF-blocked private-IP targets (unless `allow_private_ips: true` is set), a malformed or unparsable agent card, and non-retryable HTTP statuses such as 400/401/403/404/501. Only the agent-card fetch during startup is paced; failures from an already-started toolset's per-call `SendStreamingMessage` requests are not.
